## 1D-D-Crawler
**Made by:** Adriaan van Oostveen

###Description:
This is an instructable on how I made a one dimensional dungeon crawler and how to make one yourself.
In this insctructable we will go over how to connect buttons to the arduino and how to code them, how to work with an adressable RGB LED strip using the FastLED library, and more.

###Software:  

* Arduino - 1.8.1
  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
  
###Hardware:

* An Arduino
* 2 Buttons or an arcade stick
* A button
* An adressable RGB LED strip
* A power supply for the LED strip (they use 5V like the Arduino but need more Ampere than the Arduino can deliver reliably)
* Pin jumper cables
* A breadborad

1. Reference:
  Nice to have open in case you want to look up how to write something quickly.

2. Arduino/Circuit simulators:
  You can use one of these progams to simulate builds, which is nice if you don't have your parts at hand. I would recommend working with real stuff as much as possible though.
